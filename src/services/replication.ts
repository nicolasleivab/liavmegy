  // 1. Write locally âžœ append to outbox with a vector-clock revision.
  // 2. When online, open a sync session:
  //    - Push every outbox entry after the server's last known checkpoint.
  //    - Pull any deltas whose revision is newer than the client's checkpoint.
  // 3. Build an in-memory conflict graph.
  // 4. Apply your conflict-resolution strategy (LWW, domain merge, CRDT, etc.).
  // 5. Persist new state locally and update your checkpoint token.
  // 6. Clear entries in the outbox that were acknowledged by the server.

  // Example: Where you would use RxDB's replication API
  // db.comments.sync({
  //   push: async (docs) => { ... },
  //   pull: async (checkpoint) => { ... },
  //   conflictHandler: (local, remote) => resolveConflicts([local, remote]),
  // });

  // Example: Where you would use your conflict resolution
  // const merged = resolveConflicts([...localComments, ...remoteComments]);
